Predict survival on the Titanic 

Dataset Description

he data has been split into two groups:

1.training set (train.csv)

2.est set (test.csv)

The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. 

The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. For each passenger in the test set, use the model trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.

 gender_submission.csv, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.
